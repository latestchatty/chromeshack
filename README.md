## How to build

NodeJS 20.x+ and NPM 9.x+ are required, but this is also a PNPM-preferred repo (8.x+ recommended). Use `pnpm i` for installing dependencies.

- (`pnpm dev` or `npm run dev`) includes full source mapping and a WebKit/Firefox manifest in the `dist/` and `dist-firefox/` folders respectively.

- (`pnpm build` or `npm run build`) builds production code for WebKit/Firefox manifest in the `dist/` and `dist-firefox/` folders respectively.

- (`pnpm build:pkg` or `npm run build:pkg`) builds production code for WebKit/Firefox and places zipped archives in `artifacts/` for upload to AMO and CWS.
