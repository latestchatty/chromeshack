# Chrome Shack Reviewer Instructions

This add-on operates entirely within the following webpage: https://shacknews.com/chatty

The add-on options page contains a series of checkboxes that control optional features. For testing purposes, you may check every checkbox on the options page to enable all possible features.

The "Push Notifications" feature requires logging into `shacknews.com` using the reviewer username and password provided below. Upon checking this checkbox in the options page, you will be taken to a page on `winchatty.com` which prompts you to enter this username and password, and then allows push notifications to be configured.

All other features besides "Push Notifications" may be used while logged out.

- Username: "chromeshack-tester"
- Password: "PASSWORD GOES HERE"

## Note to maintainers

If these instructions are updated, then the new instructions must be pasted into AMO here under Technical Details - Whiteboard: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/chromeshack/edit

You will have to insert the actual password for the `chromeshack-tester` account into the text above. Do NOT commit this password to git.
